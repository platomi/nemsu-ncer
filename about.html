          &emsp; &emsp; Research, development, and innovation have evolved into a progressive platform that has brought together people from many cultures and backgrounds with the common goal of expanding knowledge. Due to the apparent advantages and disadvantages brought on by the pandemic, these platforms have gained traction. Recently, there has been an emphasis on the importance of conducting research in pedagogy that contributes to sustaining the educational system in the new normal. 
           The Commission of Higher Education mandates the different state universities and colleges across the country to continuously embrace the culture of doing research activities, particularly in pedagogy. Among such activities is holding a research conference that has become a popular and beneficial platform for showcasing results and advances from various fields. It provides a venue for sharing novel ideas which the academic community demands and can learn from it. Researches in education make a significant contribution to the acquisition of knowledge about other cultures and practices.
 
           The Surigao Del Sur State University, through the Office of Research and Development, recognizes the challenge in disseminating research, which is precarious in education. One of the main goals of the research is to inform and motivate people to take action. However, there are drawbacks to how to deliver and share those new ideas in research. For the benefit of learners and stakeholders, research findings should be contextualized, disseminated, and implemented. Hence, hosting the "National Conference on Educational Research" will be an excellent avenue for promoting and improving the institution's programs related to teaching practices and the development of pedagogical skills in the aspect of research. Moreover, it provides the acquisition of a new skill set needed for global communication and competitiveness, not only for the faculty and staff but also for the students. This conference will also address the need of our institution for activities related to internationalization and accreditations to stay relevant in the international community and quality standards.

        &emsp; &emsp; Surigao del Sur State University (SDSSU), formerly Surigao del Sur Polytechnic State College (SSPSC), comprises six campuses strategically located in the Province of Surigao del Sur. It achieved its status as a university through Republic Act 9998, signed on February 22, 2010. The leadership of its dynamic President, Dr. Remegita C. Olvida, and the dedication and commitment of its faculty and staff and other stakeholders for quality tertiary education and excellence all played a vital role in conferring the status of a state university to the institution after 28 years of existence. The history of the University dates back to 1982 when Bukidnon State College opened its extension in Tandag known as the Bukidnon External Studies Center. In 1992, it became the Surigao del Sur Polytechnic College. The creation of the College integrated four DECS-supervised schools in the municipalities of Cagwait, Tagbina, Lianga, and Tago. Six years later, in 1998, the College earned the status of being a state college by Republic Act 8628. In 2000, the Surigao del Sur Institute of Technology (SSIT) in Cantilan became the fifth satellite campus of the University.
